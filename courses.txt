This is a list of the major-related courses (labs, workshops, human sociology, theology) I took over my undergraduate studies at the Sharif University of Technology, and their grades are available on my transcript file (available upon request.).

== Notable Courses
Following courses were related to my main research interests, and most of them were graduate courses.\n\n
