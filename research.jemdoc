== Calculating Capacity of (Symmetric and Covariant) Pauli Channels
\n
In this project we are trying to solving the Quantum Capacities of (Symmetric & Covariant) Pauli Channels. 
Usually, calculating the classical and quantum capacities of quantum channels is very difficult. Because unlike the classical version of 
Information theory that capacity’s formula by Shannon’s second theorem is well-defined and easy to calculate, in quantum setting additivity 
doesn't hold and for the classical data, the capacity of the channel is equal to asymptotic of Holeve information. So providing tight bounds
on these quantities is very proper and helpful. If quantum channels have some specific properties, calculating the capacity becomes much more accessible.
We have considered one additional assumption and that is the channel is degradable and also we are working to extend it to higher dimensions.

== How Observation Reflects Reality of SIR Dynamic
\n
 In this work, we want to show how to estimate the real epidemic dynamics with a random sampling at a macroscopic level.We developed a mathematical 
model based on SIR dynamics and introduced a quantitative method on how to extract information from the empirical data, i.e. daily test's results and
 to use it for this estimation. Moreover, we show the impact of daily test capacity on the estimation of reality.

== Critical Behavior of a Small-World Sandpile Manna Model (B.Sc thesis)
In this job, we investigate the effect of long-ranged bonds on a regular 2d lattice for the Manna sandpile model.
In this lattice model, grains of sand are added to the system at a constant rate. However, the system's response is sporadic; avalanches of different 
sizes can occur, sometimes as large as the system itself. Probability distributions of avalanche sizes follow a power law. It displays finite-sized scaling, 
indicating that criticality exists.\n
